This is a simple sudoku app i made over the weekend for personal usage.

i wanted a clean and ad free sudoku app but couldn't find anything like i wanted so I took matters into my own hand.

This app isn't much but it does what it's supposed to do. i wrote it in react. This is my first ever react app. it also create random sudoku puzzles.

Below is a screenshot of the app.
